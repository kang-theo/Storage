# What I have:

1. Agenda_Week.docx: The original doc
2. custom-reference_generated-by-Pandoc: The style doc generated by Pandoc
   ``` pandoc --print-default-data-file reference.docx > custom-reference.docx ```
3. custom-reference_generated-by-Pandoc(modified): The style doc modified according Agenda_Week.docx, based on the doc (step 2) 
4. kTest_doc_custom_reference.Rmd: The R Markdown document
5. kTest_doc_custom_reference.docx: Final doc generated with R Markdown

# What I wanna do:

We have doc (step 1), and want to generate a doc(step 5) with R Markdown(step 4), so we use reference doc in R Markdown, that is doc (step 3) based on the doc (step 2).

# What is special:

In the doc (step 1), there are something in front of the Title, so I commented the title in preamble, and changed the rarely used "Heading 6" in the doc （which corresponds to ###### in markdown）to be with a Title style.

# Attention:

The styles in the doc is fixed. It has some to correspond to the marks in markdown. It may useless by adding new styles since it cannot be corresponded with markdown marks.
