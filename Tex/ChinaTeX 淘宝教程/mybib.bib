abstract = {This article discusses the danger of a growing digital divide between rural and other areas. It presents broadband as increasingly necessary for the delivery of information, health, education, business, social security, public and leisure services. Access to broadband has become vital for rural communities to participate in a progressively digital economy and to overcome problems of physical and social isolation. Yet rural areas are among those most excluded from fast broadband developments. Although this is partly due to technological/economic barriers in reaching more remote locations, even where technology is available, adoption can still be low in rural areas. This article explores the problems of providing broadband in rural Britain, considers various technological approaches and concludes with key development areas for policy and government.},

abstract = {Increasing economic and educational exposure, and promotion of global health and wellness can be achieved through the power of sharing knowledge, technology, and resources. ICT can play a key role in disseminating such knowledge across the world. But a digital divide exists between urban and rural/remote areas, which results in economic and social disparities across regions. Developing last-mile telecommunication technologies for rural/remote areas is a crucial aspect in providing computing and ICT services that can integrate millions of stakeholders in rural/remote areas globally into the digital age, particularly with the advent of cloud computing. This article focuses on the different aspects of providing last-mile rural telecommunication access such as interfering factors, technology options, and deployment trends. This article aims to guide service providers, industry practitioners, and local entrepreneurs with a technology-and-deployment-trend analysis to choose, deploy, and operate suitable telecommunication networks depending on the unique features of the rural/remote area. Our goal is to bring attention to accessible and affordable technologies with practical considerations.},

abstract = {Australia assigns and allocates spectrum using three broad types of regulatory approaches; command and control, property rights and open access. Each approach entails numerous pros and cons, buttressed by uncertainties over future consumer demand, interference management, barriers to entry, and technological evolution. The development and commercialisation of dynamic spectrum access technologies (DSA) requires new regulatory approaches. This article discusses an array of intermediary, dynamically efficient spectrum management approaches, which may make better use of DSA opportunities. The article then discusses the practical hurdles and legal challenges posed by their adoption and regulation in an Australian context.},

abstract = {Broadband offers key advantages as a communication infrastructure, including efficiency and cost savings which can stimulate productivity, innovation, and ultimately economic growth and social well-being. This paper presents a comparative study on the adoption of broadband in urban and regional areas. It proposes a model concerning broadband adoption which we validate with data collected using a computer-aided telephone survey. We find that relative advantage, utility outcomes, and facilitating conditions play a crucial role in explaining the broadband adoption behavior of both urban and regional household users. In a dynamic environment where technologies are changing quickly, our findings about broadband adoption drivers are useful to stakeholders such as internet service providers, regulators, broadband application developers for encouraging further broadband and application adoption and developments in communication space in both regional and urban areas.},

@article{Sale,
abstract = {Laboratory were striving to bring computing access to regional Australia even in the late 60s and early 70s. Schools throughout NSW could send pencil-marked (mark-sense) Hollerith card decks in to the University of Sydney, and the programs would be conductively read and compiled. The user would be sent back the compiler listing and any run results. At a rough estimate, a 100-card deck amounted to say 10000 characters each way with a week turnaround, or 100 millibits/sec. This is 100 times smaller than the 10 b/s that was usually achieved as a staff member of Sydney University, but it was valuable. This paper draws attention to a relatively recent development that is important to commu-nications in regional Australia, and yet which does not seem to be as fully utilised as it might be. 2. SPREAD SPECTRUM WIRELESS NETWORKING Domestic microwave ovens operate in a narrow band of radio frequencies just above 2.4 GHz. While their emissions are closely controlled through shielding, the sheer number of ovens constitutes a substantial noise source in this part of the radio spectrum. As a consequence, the band is not used by critical commercial services, and most spectrum authorities including the Australian Communications Authority (ACA, 2001) have made 2.400 to 2.484 GHz available for licence-free spread spectrum communications. Similar considerations apply in the band from 5.725 to 5.875},
